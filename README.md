[RailRoads Online! Manager](https://parampatil.github.io/Railroads-Online/)

## Working
This manager was inspired by the spreadsheet given by the developers of Railroads Online! It works exactly as the game calculates physics.

## Usage
You can check if your train will haul the load you are planning to transport.
 1) Start with setting the difficulty.
 2) Choose the maximum grade your route has to the destination.
 3) Add engines you prefer to take along with you on the journey.
 4) Add information about cargo you plan to transport.
 5) Observe the results section and try to optimise the engine and cargo.
 
 > Please keep some margin of pulling power as curves are not accounted in this calculation.


**Enjoy playing Railroads Online!**
