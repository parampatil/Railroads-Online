## Working
This manager was inspired by the spreadsheet given by the developers of Railroads Online! It works exactly as the game calculates physics.

You can check if your train will haul the load you are planning to transport.
 1) Start with setting the difficulty.
 2) Choose the maximum grade your route has to the destination.
 3) Set the weight unit you use.
 4) Add engines you prefer to take along with you on the journey.
 5) Add information about cargo you plan to transport.
 6) Observe the results section and try to optimise the engine and cargo.
 
 > Please keep some margin of pulling power as curves are not accounted in this calculation.

## Features
This manager is extremly user friendly. Some of its best fatures are:
 1) Support for Ton and Pounds units.
 2) Simple UI - No scrolling needed
 3) Clear the whole slate if you messup using **Clear Workspace** button.
 4) Add infinite amount of engines and cargo.
